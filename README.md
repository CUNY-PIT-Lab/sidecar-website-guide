</div>

This is the CUNY PIT Lab link-only integration for the canonical public
demonstration above. It tracks the same reviewed source and code, but does not
publish a second Pages site, Railway service, evaluator, or transcript store.
The current mirrored inventory contains 150 public Fortune Digital Equity routes
at Wix revision 2090. Each inert page preserves rendered public content while
removing Wix scripts, forms, tokens, trackers, and authenticated services.
Internal navigation stays within the canonical mirror; booking, forms, uploads,
and member actions lead to the live Fortune site.

The production pages remain readable when the model service is unavailable. The single production service is `https://guide-api-production-a1a1.up.railway.app`; this repository links to it and does not deploy another copy. The server keeps provider credentials private, applies per-client and shared daily limits, uses CAIL-hosted GLM-5.3-flash as its primary model, and has a bounded OpenRouter GLM-5.3-flash fallback. A cooldown coalesces warm-up traffic and keeps the primary model ready for 30 minutes.

## Source limits

The index is a public-site inventory, not a claim that every URL can support an answer. The current crawl contains:

- 90 current operational pages that may support answers.
- 30 excluded pages, including new routes awaiting review, inactive, member, upload, and administrative pages.
- 21 archived pages retained for provenance and historical navigation.
- 9 navigation records that can lead to another page but cannot establish current service facts.

Old posts, category archives, past Tech Fair pages, member surfaces, test pages, duplicate services, and archive-labelled classes do not support participant answers. Dates, locations, registration, availability, eligibility, and inventory can change. The guide sends visitors to the current Fortune page or staff for confirmation.

Every index record carries its canonical URL, authority state, content hash, proposed content owner, and Fortune-review status. The crawler keeps excluded and archived records in the inventory so reviewers can see the full routing scope.

The [August 17 source-refresh report](docs/SOURCE-REFRESH-2026-08-17.md) records the exact FAQ, workshop, route, authority, and capture changes from the prior inventory.

## Page-aware chat

The generated mock site uses the canonical path for each indexed URL. Opening the guide on a class, device, support, calendar, event, program, news, or archive page changes the guide heading, suggested questions, and page context. The interface keeps the initial state small: one question field, an explicit privacy notice, and a few prompts drawn from the current page.

The guide stays compact: two page-specific actions, one question field, a short privacy notice, and collapsed **Info** and source details. Use `?open=1` on a demonstration URL to open it for review.

After a question:

1. The browser starts a credential-free warm-up request while the visitor reads the page. The backend coalesces warm-up traffic and keeps the primary model ready for the configured period.
2. The browser sends the question, a short in-memory history, and the canonical current-page URL, path, and title.
3. The privacy gate holds likely personal information before retrieval or model use. A standalone six-digit value is treated as a possible Fortune ID.
4. Vague requests such as **help**, **device**, **class**, and **internet** still invoke the model. It answers from available public context when it can and asks a short follow-up only when the source material does not support an unambiguous answer.
5. The server checks the approved record for the current page first. A strong local match narrows the model to that record instead of emitting a fixed sentence.
6. When the current page cannot answer, retrieval ranks up to ten usable answer-authority pages from the wider public index. All 90 answer-authority records are addressable by public title. With no lexical match, the model receives a bounded set of approved current pages and must ask one useful question rather than receiving a server-written fallback.
7. Every valid, non-private new request reaches GLM-5.3-flash with the question, up to the latest five prior exchanges, and bounded public page excerpts. The model returns a concise grounded answer or a useful follow-up question. The server rejects unsupported source selections, invented factual claims, and privacy-seeking questions. Provider or quota failures remain operational errors and never become fabricated Guide turns.
8. When a page action is useful, the answer shows one discreet relevant link rather than a stack of competing cards. Provider credentials never reach the browser.

The latest completed user question includes **Edit**. The original question and answer stay visible while the visitor edits. **Update** branches from the preceding bounded context without reusing the old server conversation, and replaces the visible pair only after the revised request succeeds. **New chat** clears the tab's local conversation, continuation token, and saved session state without deleting any transcript already retained by the authorized evaluation deployment. The conversation persists while a visitor navigates among mirrored pages in the same tab.

Archive, navigation, and excluded routes still receive a tailored guide. Their page text cannot become factual answer authority. The guide moves the visitor to a current operational page.

## Privacy

The guide tells visitors: **Do not enter your six-digit Fortune ID, name, phone number, email, address, case details, or other personal information.** The browser replaces a message containing a likely six-digit Fortune ID with a privacy notice before adding it to chat history or making a network request. The backend applies the same hold before retrieval or a model call. Names, contact details, case information, health information, passwords, and similar details follow the same pre-model route.

Conversation capture is off by default. With `FORTUNE_CONVERSATION_CAPTURE=none`, the server writes no query log and needs no chat database. Browser history is compacted to the latest five exchanges in tab-scoped session storage so it survives navigation between replica pages without being shared across tabs. Open-ended questions sent to the active model must use public or invented information.

An isolated evaluation deployment may select `metadata` or `transcript` capture after Fortune approves the purpose, notice, reviewers, and retention period. Metadata mode stores identifiers and bounded routing/result fields without question or answer text. It also records server-owned interaction labels: opening or follow-up, request type, request and response language, retrieval scope, and prompt-policy version. Transcript mode stores the question and answer only when the automated privacy hold classifies the turn as clear; blocked and sensitive turns keep metadata but no message content. The hold is not guaranteed anonymization, so transcript mode is synthetic-only until Fortune approves participant use and its visible notice. Captured conversations expire after 90 days by default. See [the conversation-capture deployment contract](deployment/CONVERSATION-CAPTURE.md).

Internal Drive notes and meeting transcripts may shape navigation, ambiguity, transparency, and handoff tests. They are not participant-facing factual sources. A statement enters the public answer index only after Fortune assigns a source URL, owner, approval date, and next review date. See [deployment/TRANSCRIPT-INGESTION.md](deployment/TRANSCRIPT-INGESTION.md).

## Evaluation workspace

Railway serves a separate `/evaluation` workspace for approved synthetic transcripts. The database seeds one admin slot and three editor slots with no email, password, or invitation token. Every authenticated evaluator sees and updates the same shared workspace: **Success**, **Needs work**, the virtual **Not yet reviewed** area, and custom buckets. Moves use optimistic versions, persist in PostgreSQL, and append a transcript-free audit event attributed to the evaluator who made the change.

The workspace only lists complete, privacy-clear, unexpired conversations whose client surface is `synthetic`. Automated evaluation and capture checks use the separate `benchmark` surface, so their transcripts remain available for aggregate auditing without entering the reviewer queue. Shared conversation notes and message annotations can mark content as helpful, unclear, incorrect, a safety concern, or other; audit records retain the acting evaluator. Annotation records reference message IDs and never copy transcript text into evaluation or audit tables. Invitation tokens are generated only when an operator deliberately assigns a slot. See [the evaluation deployment contract](deployment/EVALUATION-WORKSPACE.md).

Prompts adds a shared, review-only place to suggest changes to four
presentation modules. It cannot change grounding, privacy, validation, or the
deployed prompt. See the [versioned prompt history](prompts/README.md) and the
[Meeting 4 intervention report](docs/MEETING-4-INTERVENTIONS.md).

Run the content-free aggregate release gate with `DATABASE_URL` supplied through the environment:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit_conversation_quality.py
```

## Local commands

Run the key-free tests and check that the index can produce all route shells:

```bash
./run.sh test
python3 scripts/build_pages.py --check-index
```

The current release passes 389 Python tests, 32 browser-core and bridge tests, and 18 snapshot-capture safety tests across retrieval, API contracts, privacy, source authority, grounding, conversation persistence, the crawler, the Pages builder, production limits, warm-up behavior, responsive layout, member access, styling safeguards, and Wix secret handling.

The [Website Guide evaluation suite](evals/website-guide/README.md) adds a fixed 41-case synthetic benchmark across broad and specific intent, typos, multilingual requests, privacy, adversarial input, page awareness, follow-up context, and input boundaries. Its executable gates are stricter than the unit tests and produce a versioned run record for staff review.

Build the static GitHub Pages output:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_pages.py
python3 -m http.server 8791 --directory _site
```

The build writes 150 `index.html` route snapshots under `_site/`, including the root route, and copies only the shared files that the replica and sidecar require.

Run the live local model demo:

```bash
export OLLAMA_API_KEY="your Ollama Cloud key"
./run.sh
```

The launcher uses `http://127.0.0.1:8790`, leaves an occupied port untouched, and keeps the credential in the server process.

Refresh the public Wix index manually when a source review is planned:

```bash
./run.sh index
python3 scripts/build_pages.py --check-index
./run.sh test
```

The refresh obeys `robots.txt`, rate-limits requests, retries `429` responses, and rewrites `site-index.json`. Review content-hash changes, authority changes, removed URLs, partial responses, and volatile service information before accepting the refreshed file.

## Weekly source review

The repository scaffold includes a Monday 13:17 UTC index-refresh check and a manual dispatch in [`.github/workflows/refresh-index.yml`](.github/workflows/refresh-index.yml). The check preserves the checked-in index as `baseline-site-index.json`, creates a refreshed `site-index.json`, validates that it can build all route shells, and uploads both files for 14 days in an artifact named `fortune-site-index-review-<run number>`.

The refresh check has read-only repository permission. It does not commit, push, deploy, or treat changed public text as approved. A reviewer compares the two index files, confirms source authority and volatile claims with Fortune staff, then deliberately accepts any approved update and rebuilds `_site/`.

## Wix and GitHub Pages

The [deployment overview](deployment/README.md) carries the shared API contract.

- [Wix app subset](wix-app/README.md) contains the administrator key form, Admin-only Wix Secrets Manager methods, backend-only secret reader, embedded-script fragment, and site guide element. [The earlier roadmap](deployment/wix/ROADMAP.md) retains the extension-selection history.
- [Copilot Studio bridge](deployment/wix/copilot-studio-bridge/README.md) is an optional, separately hosted Direct Line embed for evaluating Fortune's Microsoft agent on Wix without exposing its channel secret. It is limited to approved public information and does not replace the guide's pre-provider privacy and source-authority checks.
- [GitHub Pages roadmap](deployment/github-pages/ROADMAP.md) describes the public replica, the source-backed static state, the active-model backend, and the review gates before sharing the URL with Jacob and the Fortune team.

The canonical repository's Pages workflow builds the allowlisted `_site/`
directory and publishes the single public artifact. This PIT Lab integration
does not include a Pages workflow or publish a second artifact.

The provider remains behind the server contract. Fortune can later change the approved model route without rebuilding the participant interface.

## GitHub publication

The demonstration has a dedicated public repository at [zmuhls/fortune-digital-equity-guide-demo](https://github.com/zmuhls/fortune-digital-equity-guide-demo). Its repository root contains only the demonstration source, tests, workflows, and deployment notes. GitHub Actions builds the allowlisted static artifact and publishes it at [zmuhls.github.io/fortune-digital-equity-guide-demo](https://zmuhls.github.io/fortune-digital-equity-guide-demo/). The public Pages version uses the HTTPS model backend configured in `config.js`. If that service is unavailable, the replicated pages and source navigation remain readable, while chat reports that it is unavailable instead of substituting an unlogged browser answer.

## Suggested meeting path

1. Open a route with `?open=1` and press one page-specific starter.
2. Open a second mock route and show that its page context changes while the conversation remains available in the same tab.
3. Ask a page-specific question and follow the related route to another mock page.
4. Enter `device` to show one clarifying question.
5. Ask about an Excel topic to show retrieval of a specific class page.
6. Enter `123456` to show the pre-model Fortune ID privacy hold.
7. Stop the backend and show that the static page context and source links remain available.
